name: pbcoreRelationType
definition: pbcoreRelationType describes the relationship between the asset being describe by the PBCore document and any other asset. Ideally it would contain text from a controlled vocabulary for describing relationships. There is some depth to what a relationship could be. The assets can be related as different episodes in a series, different tapes in a box set, or different versions of an original, among others.
