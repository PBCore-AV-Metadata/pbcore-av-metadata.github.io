<h3>PBCore and MARC</h3>
<p>This documentation below provides recommendations for converting from the PBCore metadata standard to MARC 21. Since MARC has more fields than PBCore, there may be multiple recommendations for the same PBCore element, depending on context and desired level of detail. The documentation includes recommendations for both simple and complex mappings. MARC 21 fields are listed by field number with specific subfields if applicable.

This mapping includes all PBCore elements, but does not include all possible attributes to those elements. Attribute mappings are included when attributes are required within PBCore, or when mapping an attribute would allow for a more specific mapping within MARC.

These documents do not provide recommendations for converting from MARC 21 to PBCore, although it may in some cases be used as a guideline for such work.
