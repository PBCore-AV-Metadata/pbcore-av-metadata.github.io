  <h3>Demo Records for PBCore Root Elements</h3>
  <p>Here are some demo PBCore records for each <a href="/elements/root">root element</a>, provided in XML and human-readable text format, including a PBCore Asset record, a PBCore Instantiation record, a PBCore Asset record grouping multiple Instantiations, and a PBCore Collection record grouping multiple assets. You can refer to these records to see how PBCore concepts could be implemented in real-world scenarios. Select the Root Element you would like to see an example for below.</p>

    <h3>Real-world Example Records</h3>
    <p>Here are some example records gathered from organizations that are actually using PBCore. Each organization uses PBCore slightly differently to fit their specific needs. See if any of those needs align with yours, and if you're using PBCore in a different way, contact PBCoreInfo@wgbh.org to add an example record to this page.</p>
