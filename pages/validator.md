<h2 class="red title">PBCore XML Validator</h2>

The PBCore Validator can tell you if a PBCore xml file that you have is valid. When expressed as xml, PBCore can be validated against the [XSD](xsd.html) or XML Schema Definition. It's important to make sure xml files are valid because it ensures that other people will be able to read and understand your metadata. If your xml does not validate, both computers and possibly other humans trying to read your metadata, may not be able to understand what it's trying to express.

The Validator takes one xml file at a time, which you can either upload from your local machine or copy and paste into a window. You can then set which version of PBCore you want to validate against.
