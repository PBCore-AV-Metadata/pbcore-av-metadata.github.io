<h2>Root Elements</h2>

Each XML document has exactly one single root element. It encloses all the other elements and is therefore the sole parent element to other elements. PBCore includes a number of root elements that can be used discretely: DescriptionDocument, CollectionDocument, and InstantiationDocument. Root elements are also called parent elements.
