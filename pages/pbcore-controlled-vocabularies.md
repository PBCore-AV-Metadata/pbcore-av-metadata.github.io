    <p>
      PBCore Controlled Vocabularies are sets of predefined, community-standardized terms for concepts related to audiovisual and broadcast collections. These terms can be used as drop-down value lists in a database or spreadsheet to ensure consistency in terminology, formatting and spelling, both internally and when exchanging information with outside organizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      PBCore Controlled Vocabularies include the agreed-upon spelling and formatting for each term, a definition, and a Unique Resource Identifier (or URI). The vocabularies provide only the terms that the community has determined are most widely used and shared, and are not 100% comprehensive. PBCore does not maintain controlled vocabularies for elements that have strong vocabulary options maintained by other authorities. Element pages contain links to relevant external vocabularies, where applicable.
