<h2 class="dark-grey title bold">Annual Meeting Notes</h2>

<p>The PBCore Advisory Sub-Committee of the Association of Moving Image Archivists (AMIA) Cataloging and Metadata Committee has generally held its annual meeting at the <a href="http://www.amiaconference.net/">Association of Moving Image Archivists (AMIA) conference</a> to discuss PBCoreâ€™s development over the preceding year and make a plan for the year ahead. Although the meeting is often in-person at the conference, non-AMIA members with an interest in PBCore are welcome to participate remotely. In 2023, the attendees at the in-person meeting decided to move the discussion to a fully-virtual general meeting (held in early 2024) to allow for broader attendance; the notes included for 2023 are from the virtual meeting.</p>
