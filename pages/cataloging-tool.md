    <p>
      The PBCore Cataloging Tool is designed to support the creation, editing, and export of moving image-related inventory metadata as PBCore XML records. With a user-friendly data entry interface and full support of all PBCore elements and attributes, the tool makes creating valid PBCore XML documents as easy as filling out
a spreadsheet.
The PBCore Cataloging Tool is designed to be used in conjunction with the PBCore Spreadsheet Templates, and can import and export metadata in the full PBCore Spreadsheet Template format.*
