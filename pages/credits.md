<h2 class="blue title bold">Credits</h2>

The PBCore website and the tools it features were made possible by the generous support of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and key contributions from many individuals and organizations, including WGBH Media Library and Archives, the Simmons Usability Lab, WGBH Creative, MediaArea, Myers Infosys, Digital Bedrock, and the members of the PBCore Development and Training Project Advisory Board: Rebecca Guenther, Julie Hardesty, Morgan Morel, and Kara Van Malssen. The site was translated into Spanish thanks to the dedicated efforts of Lorena Ramírez-López, Gloria Ana Diez, Valeria Dávila, and Tzutzumatzin Soto, with the collaboration of the Association of Moving Image Archivists (AMIA).

PBCore would not be possible without the generous support of volunteers from the AMIA PBCore Advisory Sub-Committee.
