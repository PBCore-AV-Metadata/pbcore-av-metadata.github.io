<h2 class="red title bold">Teaching PBCore</h2>

In March 2019, the WGBH Educational Foundation hosted a two-day workshop titled "Teaching PBCore: Resources for A/V Metadata in the Classroom" with support from NEH. The workshop was designed to support educators teaching metadata at library and archival science programs in developing curriculum materials around PBCore. 

After the workshop, attendees supplied sample syllabi, lesson plans, and educational materials for PBCore instruction. These resources are collected here, and may be supplemented in the future with additional PBCore resources provided by trainers and educators.
