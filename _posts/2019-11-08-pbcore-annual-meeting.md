We hope to see many of you at the PBCore Advisory Sub-Committee meeting at the annual AMIA conference next week! This year's meeting will be held on Friday, November 15th, from 5:45-6:45 PM. <span class="end-blurb"></span>

You can find the agenda for the meeting <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-uWAiYsaKbYIAvhM8HxIrEb1VBRVNqePdZpuiT7uziA/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a>

Please note that the agenda includes a link to the latest draft version of the PBCore Handbook, which we are hoping to publish shortly after the conference. Based on suggestions we received on the first draft version of the Handbook, the updated version contains some changed language in the "What Is PBCore?", "Glossary," and "PBCore Structure" sections that we hope will clarify the use of PBCore for new users. However, since the original language was collaboratively developed by the community during the schema and website overhaul in 2015, we wanted to make sure we had an opportunity to hear feedback from the community before pushing those changes. If you have a chance to review before AMIA, please come to the meeting with your thoughts for discussion ready.

As you can see on the agenda, we're also planning to reserve some time during the meeting for PBCore users to present on how they've been incorporating the standard at their institution. If you're interested in presenting a lightning talk or sharing a case study, please email PBCoreInfo@wgbh.org!

If you won't be at the AMIA conference, but would like to attend the meeting virtually, comment or email PBCoreInfo@wgbh.org -- we'll have a Google Hangout available for distance participants.

Looking forward to seeing you there!
