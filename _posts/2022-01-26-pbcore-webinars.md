In the fall of 2021, GBH and the Northeast Document Conservation Center co-hosted an introductory PBCore webinar series. All live webinars were recorded at the time of broadcast, and are now available to watch for free on the NEDCC <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSqxpHY476Jy2drZRl7uuqKTOfmyNeKPP"> YouTube Channel. 

The webinar series contains five programs:

Each webinar contains approximately half an hour of lecture instruction, followed by a hands-on activity. The lectures are included in the recorded series in their entirety; some activities and discussion are also included, but others occurred primarily in breakout sessions, which were not recorded. 

Viewers of the recorded webinars are welcome to reach out with questions or to discuss the activities with the instructor by emailing pbcoreinfo@wgbh.org.
