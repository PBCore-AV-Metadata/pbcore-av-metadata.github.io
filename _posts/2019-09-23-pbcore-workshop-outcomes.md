Back in March, we invited PBCore public media users and educators to WGBH for in-depth workshops focused on overcoming the barriers to PBCore adoption and education. Now, attendees have shared their outcomes.

## PBCore for Public Media Organizations

The first workshop, PBCore for Public Media Organizations, was targeted towards staff at public media organizations looking to better track information about their content. Attendees did sample data modelling and spent hands-on time practicing with tools and utilities to support the creation and storage of PBCore metadata.

Attendees reported back to WGBH with outcomes on how they are incorporating PBCore into the daily work of their organization, including some additional documentation:

## Teaching PBCore: Resources for A/V Metadata in the Classroom

The second workshop, Teaching PBCore: Resources for A/V Metadata in the Classroom, was designed to support educators teaching metadata at library and archival science programs in developing curriculum materials around PBCore. In addition to reviewing tools, crosswalks, and mappings, educators in attendance discussed lesson plans, syllabi, and best practices for teaching audiovisual metadata. 

After the workshop, attendees supplied sample syllabi, lesson plans, and educational materials for PBCore instruction. These materials are also now collected under the 'Resources' tab of the website on a page called 'Teaching PBCore.'
