Applications open for PBCore Workshop travel grants

<span class="end-blurb"></span>

GBH Archives invites applications to receive travel funding for the first of two upcoming in-person 1.5-day PBCore training workshops for archivists, media collection managers, production professionals, and anyone else interested in best practices for managing metadata around audiovisual collections. The workshop will provide extensive hands-on training with PBCore and the existing suite of PBCore tools, as well as offering attendees the opportunity to bring real-world cataloging problems and use cases to the workshop for discussion.
 
The first workshop will be held August 24-25th at GBH facilities in Boston, Massachusetts. Thanks to a generous grant from NEH, the workshops are offered free of charge; in addition, fifteen attendees will receive full funding to attend, with travel costs, accommodations, and meals provided through the workshop. A strong applicant will be able to commit to attending the workshop and fulfilling documentation requirements, and will be able to make a clear argument for how the training will provide impact and value on an individual and/or institutional level. (Due to federal restrictions, we are unable to provide travel funding from or to locations outside of the United States.)

Application deadline: May 31, 2023
Applications will be notified of application status by June 15, 2023
 
General registration for the workshop will open after travel scholarships have been determined. Total attendance at the workshop will be capped at 25 attendees.
