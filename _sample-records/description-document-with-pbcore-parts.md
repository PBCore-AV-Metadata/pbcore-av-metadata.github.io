            text: The legend of Jesse James is one of America’s most familiar myths – and one of its most wrong-headed. James, so the legend goes, was a Western outlaw, but in reality, he never went west. He has been called American’s own Robin Hood, yet he robbed both rich and poor, and was never seen to share his ill-gotten gains. He was known as a gunfighter – but his victims were almost always unarmed. Less heroic than brutal, James was a member of a vicious band of Missouri guerrillas during the Civil War, and sought vengeance for the Confederate defeat afterwards. In a life steeped in prolific violence and bloodshed, he met what was perhaps the most fitting end.
